# CS455_Full_SourceCode
This is the README file for delivable #3 for CS 455 - Artificial Intelligence

This project uses machine learning to classify images of plates as either clean or dirty. It was developed for the CS455 course and applies a convolutional neural network (CNN) using torch, torch vision, scikit-learn, and numpy for the code libraries.

The dataset used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle and must be manually added before running the notebook. Once the dataset is downloaded, the user should place the image files into folders named "clean" and "dirty" inside a folder called "data". The notebook has this structure when loading and processing the images.

To run this project, make sure Python is installed along with the following libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, torch, and scikit-learn. These can be installed using pip if not already available. The notebook file is named CLEANvsDIRTY.ipynb and can be run in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. A user can also choose to run the .py file as well as they are they same contents, but in different file types.

All core code for loading data, training the model, evaluating results, and visualizing metrics is contained in the notebook. The solution is complete and runs successfully when the dataset is added as described.

Any external code used has been cited directly in the comments. The project also makes use of open-source Python libraries as allowed by the assignment, and the dataset was used in accordance with its Kaggle license.

Please make sure the dataset is added before running the notebook or the code will fail to load images.
